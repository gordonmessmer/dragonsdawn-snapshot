    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para><command>snapshot</command> will determine which filesystems
    contain the named directories and attempt to make snapshots of
    each.  It will first run each of the scripts in
    its <filename>writers.d</filename> directory with the
    argument <emphasis>freeze</emphasis> followed by a list of
    directories being backed up, signaling to applications that they
    should make their data consistent and stop writing new data. Next
    it will make snapshots of each of the filesystems containing the
    directories given as arguments.  When the snapshots have been made
    and mounted, <command>snapshot</command> will once again run the
    scripts in <filename>writers.d</filename> with the
    argument <emphasis>thaw</emphasis> to notify applications that
    they can resume writing data.  At this point,
    the <command>snapshot</command> program will close its stdout.
    Closing this file descriptor signals to the caller that the
    snapshots are ready.  <command>snapshot</command> will then wait
    for its stdin to be closed.  When that occurs, the snapshots will
    be umounted and removed.</para>

    <title>USAGE</title>

    <para>The <command>snapshot</command> script will
    accept <emphasis>-t path</emphasis> as an option indicating a path
    where the snapshots should be mounted.  This path is the "target".
    The remaining arguments indicate what directories are going to be
    backed up.</para>

    <para>After calling <command>snapshot</command>, the backup
    application should wait for the stdout file descriptor to close.
    The backup application should then proceed to back up its desired
    directories, treating the target (which defaults
    to <filename>/mnt</filename>) as the root directory.</para>

    <para>When backup are complete, the backup application should
    close <command>snapshot</command>'s stdin file descriptor and wait
    for it to exit.</para>
